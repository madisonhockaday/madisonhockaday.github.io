				<div class="about-description">
					<p>Hi there! Thank you so much for visiting my website!</p>
					<p>My name is Madison Hockaday, I am 21 years old, and am currently attending Berklee College of Music in Boston. When I was two years old, I was inspired by the Disney Orchestra on TV, which led to the beginning of violin lessons at five years old on one of the smallest violins you could ever imagine, and I have been in love with music ever since. It has been a long and challenging road filled with many instruments and a myriad of opportunities, but it has been worth every step. I cannot wait for what is to come! But for now, I would just like to share the first five songs in my songwriting catalogue with you, that have been released on my debut EP “5”.</p>
					<p>Please take a listen, and if you decide to buy “5”, I would like to let you know that the money will be donated to the Anthony Rizzo Family Foundation. If you decide you don’t want to purchase the EP and you’d still like to donate, <a href="http://rizzo44.com" target="_blank">please  do so here</a>. Thanks again! I hope you like what you hear!</p>
